        <h3>Understanding How Reve Image Works</h3>
        <p>
          At its core, Reve Image utilizes advanced deep learning models trained on millions of images to understand the
          relationship between text and visual elements. When you enter a prompt, Reve Image analyzes the semantic
          meaning and generates corresponding imagery that matches your description. This process happens in seconds,
          allowing for rapid iteration and experimentation.
        </p>

        <h3>Crafting Effective Prompts for Reve Image</h3>
        <p>
          The key to getting exceptional results from Reve Image lies in how you structure your prompts. Begin with a
          clear subject, then add modifiers for style, mood, lighting, and composition. For example, instead of simply
          writing "a mountain," try "a majestic snow-capped mountain at golden hour, with dramatic clouds,
          photorealistic style." The Reve Image AI responds particularly well to descriptive adjectives and specific
          visual references.
        </p>
